# Custom-Hash-Function-Implementation-and-Comparison
A Python project that implements a custom hash function using ASCII manipulation, bit operations, and modular arithmetic. It generates fixed-length hashes, demonstrates the avalanche effect, and compares results with SHA-256 to illustrate core hashing principles and data integrity concepts.
